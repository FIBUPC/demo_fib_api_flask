# FIB API 2.0 - Flask example

## Install

Requirements `python 2.7` or `python 3.5`.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

- Copy `config.py.sample` to `config.py`: `cp config.py.sample config.py`
- Create Raco API Application [here](https://api.fib.upc.edu/v2/o/applications/register/), with redirect url `http://localhost:5001/login/authorized` (or whatever url your server is running in)
- Replace _client secret_ and _client id_ in `config.py`

Optionally you can set environment variables instead. You would need the folling environment variables defined:

- _secret_key_: Web server random secret key.
- _consumer_key_: Your app `client_key`.
- _consumer_secret_: Your app `client_secret`.

### Production

- Set DEBUG to False in config.py
- Create a random secret key. 
    - Optional: You can create a random key by using the following python code
    
``` python
import os
os.urandom(24)
```

## Deployment
You can easily start the server with `python app.py`.

In production, you should use something like [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/) to serve this. You can run the app with `gunicorn -b :<PORT> -w <number of workers> wsgi`.

## Heroku

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

With the above button you can deploy straight to Heroku. When deploying you will need to set the secret key, consumer key and consumer secret, as described above in the configuration section. Make sure that the redirect url for your API application points to `á»³our-herokuapp-name.herokuapp.com` (replacing your-herokuapp-name with whatever is your Heroku application name).
